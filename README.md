# InfinityTable

Description:

Partially finished project to create a custom infinity table. Currently works as a typical infinity table using LED's and mirror tinting to create an infinity effect. However bottom layer glass is also mirror tinted rather than typical mirror. This will allow for LED array underneath to function as low resolution display for simple games.

Attributes:

- 4 layer LED
- WiFi controllable

Materials:

- Oak (Bunnings)
- - 65x12mm
- - 30x8mm
- - 65x12mm
- Pine (Bunnings)
- - 776x476x18mm
- Corner Brackets and Screws (Bunnings)
- 60 leds/m -non-waterproof -ws2812B -black -5m (Amazon)
- Switching LED Power Supply 220VAC-5VDC 40A (Ebay)
- Arduino ATMega with WiFi (ESP8266) (Jaycar)

Roadmap:
- Add 4x4 pixel alphabet to enable message display
- Install LED array underneath bottom layer along with acrylic sheet for diffusion.
- Install two distance sensors either side of table to function as simple control interface.
- Program MCU to run simple games (ping pong, game of life, etc.).
